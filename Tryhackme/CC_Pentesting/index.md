## Enumeration
As usual , I will start with enumerating machine for services running on ports.

![nmap result](nmap%20result.png)

nmap results clearly shows 2 open ports which are http and ssh. Let's focus on http first.

## Dirctory enumeration
Let's start enumerating directories using gobuster.

![gobuster](gobuster%201.png)

/secret/ is interesting directory. It's blank with no content so let's enumerate it further. Also check for specific file extensions such as php and txt

![gobuster /secret](gobuster%202.png)

/secret/secret.txt file , definately giving clue here.

![secret.txt](secret.txt.png)

so "nyan" is username and next phrase can be password or hash of password.

## Hash cracking
Tried login into ssh with username as nyan and password as other phrase. Didn't quite worked so let's try identifying hash.

![identifying hash](identifying%20hash.png)

So this hash can be SHA-1 hash. Let's try cracking this hash using john the ripper.

![cracking hash](john%20hash%20cracking.png)

So user nyan has password same as nyan. Let's login into ssh using this credentials.

## Getting flags
Login into ssh gives us user flag directly. Also we have sudo access with NOPASS for su command. Checking gtfobins shows us easy way to escalte priviledge.

![flags](getting%20flags.png)

Got both flags!!ðŸ¥³
